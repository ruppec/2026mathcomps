# Bézout’s Theorem

Note:
We’ve shown you a bunch of pictures. Now I want to end with one theorem that
explains why projective space is not just “a different coordinate system,” but
a place where geometry stops having annoying special cases.


### **m × n intersection points**
…as long as you count correctly:
- a tangency counts as multiple intersections,
- and points at infinity count too.
