Here we are visualizing a quartic surface containing a line in the spherical
geometry of $\mathbb{RP}^3$.

In the space of all quartic surfaces it is exceedingly rare that one contains a
line, specifically it occurs with measure zero.

We are further refining our interest in quartic surfaces defined by two cubic
curves.

Note that if a plane contains a line $L$ that lines a quartic surface, then the
intersection of that plane with the quartic surface will be a quartic curve
containing a line, meaning the remaining curve will be of degree at most 3
(allowing for multiplicity of $L$).

If without loss of generality let's let $L = \{ x_0 = x_1 = 0 \}$, then given two
cubic curves, $p(x_0,x_2, x_3)$ and $q(x_1, x_2, x_3_)$ we define the quartic
surface

$$ f = x_0 p + x_1 q$$

which vanishes on $L$ since then $x_0=x_1=0$. When $x_0=0$ we recover $f= x_1 q$
and when $x_1 = 0$ we recover $f = x_0 p$. So these defining curves live on the
surface in orthogonal planes. If we consider the whole family of planes
containing $L$ we get a corresponding smooth family of cubic curves.
This is an example of (a real slice of) an elliptic K3 surface.
